# Debugging & Reporting Bugs

This page is for users who hit a problem with fusionlocalserver and want to report it. It explains how to capture enough diagnostic information that the maintainers can reproduce and fix the issue without a long back-and-forth.

fusionlocalserver is a single HTTP server (a JSON API plus an embedded React/MUI web UI). Everything below is about its logging and how to file a useful defect.

If you're a contributor looking for the test-suite architecture, see [`testing.md`](testing.md). If you want internals on the GraphQL client and its retry behaviour, see [`api.md`](api.md).

## Where logs go

The server uses a single `log/slog` logger that writes to **two** places at once:

| Sink | Contents |
|---|---|
| The **console** (stdout) | The same lines you see in the terminal that launched the server. |
| `~/.config/fusionlocalserver/server.log` | A persistent copy of every log line. Mode `0600`, appended (not truncated) across runs. |

On Linux and macOS the path is exactly `~/.config/fusionlocalserver/`. On Windows it's `%USERPROFILE%\.config\fusionlocalserver\` (the same shape — the app uses `os.UserHomeDir()` directly rather than the OS-specific config dir).

The log file is local to your machine; nothing is sent anywhere automatically. You decide what (if anything) to share when you file a defect.

---

## Log levels

The default level is **info** — essential lines only: startup URLs, warnings, errors, and auth events (login complete, session expired, callback errors). That keeps day-to-day output quiet.

Run with `-v` to raise the level to **debug**. This applies to both sinks (console and `server.log`) and adds:

- **One line per HTTP request** — method, path, query, status, byte count, duration, and remote IP.
- **GraphQL request/response traces** from the `api` package — the full request body and response for each upstream APS call, plus retry decisions.

```sh
fusionlocalserver -v
```

You can tail the file from another terminal while reproducing:

```sh
tail -f ~/.config/fusionlocalserver/server.log
```

## What's safe to share

The logger never records secrets:

- **Access tokens and `Authorization` headers are never logged.** No bearer token appears in any log line, at any level.
- **`signedUrl` values are redacted** from GraphQL traces (replaced with `[redacted]`). A signed URL is itself a bearer credential for the derivative it points at, so its value never reaches the log even under `-v`.
- **GraphQL response bodies** are logged verbatim under `-v`. They contain item names, project names, hub names, file sizes, and other metadata. If your project names themselves are confidential, redact those before sharing.

There is no separate token file to worry about: per-user sessions live only in server memory, so there is nothing on disk to accidentally attach.

## When a request fails or the server misbehaves

A panic in any request handler is **recovered**: the server logs the panic message and a full stack trace at error level, returns a JSON `500 internal server error` to the browser, and keeps running. So a single bad request can't take the process down — but the stack in `server.log` is exactly what we need to fix it.

If a data request returns an unexpected error in the UI, re-run with `-v`, reproduce, and the failing request and its GraphQL trace will be in `server.log`.

## Filing a bug — checklist

When you open an issue at <https://github.com/schneik80/fusionlocalserver/issues>, please include:

1. **Version** — fetch `GET /api/meta` from the running server (e.g. `curl http://localhost:8080/api/meta`); the `version` field is what we need. It's also logged at startup and shown in the web UI's About dialog.
2. **OS and browser** — e.g. "macOS 14.5, Safari 17" or "Linux Fedora 40, Chrome 124".
3. **What you did** — three to five lines is plenty. "Signed in, picked the *IMA* hub, selected the *RC* project, drilled into *Designs*, opened the Uses tab on a 200-component assembly."
4. **What you expected vs. what happened** (and the failing request/URL if you can see it — the browser devtools Network tab shows the `/api/...` call that errored).
5. **The relevant slice of `server.log`**, ideally captured with `-v` so it includes the per-request lines and GraphQL traces around the failure. The last few hundred lines around the failure are usually enough.
6. **The recovered-panic block** in full if the server returned a 500 — the `panic recovered` log line carries the stack trace.

If the issue is a slow or flaky API call, we'll usually want to see at least one full GraphQL request/response pair plus any retry lines that fired.

A good bug-report skeleton:

```
Version: v0.1.0   (from GET /api/meta)
OS: macOS 14.5 (Apple Silicon)
Browser: Safari 17

Steps:
1. Started: fusionlocalserver -v
2. Signed in, selected hub "IMA"
3. Selected project "RC"
4. Drilled into "Mechanical Drawings"
5. Selected design "2021-02"
6. Opened the Drawings tab

Expected: list of drawings made from the design.
Actual: tab shows "Error: Query point value 23066 exceeds maximum...".
Failing request: GET /api/items/drawings?...

## Common log signatures and what they mean

Under `-v` these are the GraphQL-trace patterns that show up most often. Recognising them helps you tell whether you've hit something we already know about.

### Retry lines (`attempt=N`, `delay=…`)

The retry layer kicked in. The client wraps each GraphQL call in a 3-attempt retry loop for transient APS gateway flakiness — see [`api.md`](api.md#error-handling-and-retry). Seeing one or two retries is fine; seeing the loop bottom out with `APS GraphQL flaky after 3 attempts: …` after every action is a real bug worth filing.

### `code:NOT_FOUND, errorType:UNKNOWN, service:cw`

The APS Manufacturing Data Model gateway returns this intermittently for hub URNs it just successfully enumerated. It's an upstream bug, not yours. The retry layer absorbs it for root-level paths automatically.

### `Query point value <N> exceeds maximum allowed query point value 1000`

The GraphQL gateway rejected the request as too expensive. If this comes from a query that *we* sent, that's a real bug — please file it with the request line so we can shrink the query. The drawings tab in particular has tight limits because of this cap; see [`api.md`](api.md#getdrawingsfordesign--drawings-tab-on-a-designitem) for the trade-off.

### `unauthorized (HTTP 401)` / 401 from a data endpoint

The session's access token is stale, was revoked, or lacks the `data:read` / `user-profile:read` scope. The web UI turns a 401 from the API into a prompt to sign in again. If a fresh sign-in still produces 401, the APS app registration may be misconfigured — see [`authentication.md`](authentication.md).

### `GraphQL partial errors (kept data): …`

A response came back with both useful data and field-level errors. The client kept the data and surfaced the errors via this log line. Typically harmless — common when one row in a list references a deactivated or deleted record. If a tab unexpectedly shows missing fields, the corresponding `GraphQL partial errors` line identifies which row.

### `ClassifyAssembly` query bursts after a folder load

When a folder's contents load, the app dispatches up to 50 small `componentVersion(...).occurrences(pagination: { limit: 1 })` queries in parallel, capped at 8 concurrent in flight by a semaphore. Under `-v` this shows up as a burst of similar requests right after the `itemsByFolder` / `itemsByProject` response. Each one returns a single-result list (or empty) and refines a row's icon to assembly or part. If those queries 401 or get rate-limited, the corresponding rows silently keep their generic design icon — failures here never block navigation. See [`api.md`](api.md#classifyassembly--asyncpartassembly-subtype) for the query and the concurrency cap.

## Privacy and security

- `server.log` is written with mode `0600` (owner-only read/write).
- Per-user sessions live only in server memory; there is no on-disk token file.
- The `Authorization` header is never logged, and `signedUrl` values are redacted from traces.
- Nothing is uploaded automatically. Logs stay on your machine until you choose to share them.

If you find a bug that *does* leak tokens or other sensitive data into a log, please report it privately rather than filing a public issue — see `SECURITY-TODO.md` and the security-fix history (PR #1) for how the project handles such reports.
