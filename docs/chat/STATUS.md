# Project chat — status

Tracks `PLAN.md` (the adapted implementation plan) against what has shipped.
Spec: `centrifuge-chat-design.md`, adapted per the deviations recorded in
PLAN.md (file store instead of Postgres, stdlib SSE instead of centrifuge,
flat query-param REST, APS-backed roles).

## Shipped

| Phase | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Store, invariants, authz, REST, polling Chat tab | `chat/{types,store,jsonl,authz,ratelimit}.go`, `server/handlers_chat.go`, `web/src/chat/` |
| 2 | SSE hub, `/api/chat/events`, publish-on-write, reset/replay recovery | `chat/hub.go`, `server/handlers_chat_events.go` |
| 3 | Live frontend over SSE, optimistic sends, polling as fallback | `web/src/chat/useChatEvents.ts`, `cache.ts` |
| 4 | Threads UI (landed early, phase 1–3), **read cursors + unreads** (`cursors.json`, `PATCH /api/chat/read`, `GET /api/chat/unreads`, user-only `read.updated` sync across own tabs), **typing indicators** (`POST /api/chat/typing`, ephemeral id-less SSE frames), **reaction picker** with server-side emoji allowlist, unread badges (sidebar counts + Chat tab total) | `chat/cursors.go`, `chat/emoji.go`, `web/src/chat/{typing.ts,TypingIndicator.tsx}` |
| 5 | Private-channel UI (create with member picker, member management, leave), channel menu (rename/topic/archive) for moderators + creators, `GET /api/chat/members` roster, security pass | `web/src/chat/ChannelMenu.tsx`, `docs/security/CHAT-SECURITY.md`, chat fuzz targets in `server/fuzz_security_test.go` |

Event vocabulary on the wire: `message.created/updated/deleted`,
`reaction.added/removed`, `channel.created/updated/archived`,
`channel.member_added/member_removed`, `channel.activity`, `read.updated`
(user-only), `typing` (ephemeral, no SSE id), plus the named `reset` frame.

## Manual checkpoint matrix (two browsers, two Autodesk accounts)

- [ ] Phase 4: unread badge counts on sidebar + Chat tab; mark-read in one
      tab clears the badge in the same user's second tab; "N is typing…"
      appears within a ping and clears when the message lands or ~5 s pass;
      first reaction placeable via the picker; off-palette REST reaction 400s.
- [ ] Phase 5: private channel invisible to a third member (404 on direct
      access); visible to a project Administrator; adding a member makes the
      channel appear in their sidebar live; removing (or leaving) drops it
      live; rename/topic/archive gated to moderators + creator; root channel
      refuses rename/archive.
- [ ] Group-only access: a user whose project role comes solely from a group
      (not a direct member) can open Chat and post — no "you do not have
      access" error — but sees no moderation affordances.

(Phases 1–3 checkpoints were verified when those phases landed; see git
history around the `feat: project chat phase N` commits.)

## Open questions carried forward

- **Resolved — group-only members** (PLAN.md open question 3). Users whose
  project access comes through a group aren't in `folderLevelProjectMembers`,
  so the phase-3 authorizer 403'd them out of chat entirely ("you do not have
  access"). Fixed in `chat/authz.go`: a caller whose *own token* can read the
  project roster has project access, so if they aren't individually listed
  they're treated as a **group-derived contributor** (read/post/react/edit-own/
  create-channel, never moderate). Third-party checks (private-channel
  invitees) stay strict via `IsActiveMember`. See `docs/security/CHAT-SECURITY.md`.

Unchanged from PLAN.md: OIDC `sub` vs GraphQL user id (email fallback in
place), FolderRoleEnum casing (case-insensitive match in place), HTTP/1.1
6-connection limit (use `-tls` HTTP/2 for many tabs), Vite-direct SSE
buffering (use the proxy), Windows AV on JSONL opens (retry in place), no
frontend test harness (checkpoints).
