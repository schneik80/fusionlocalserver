// Package whiteboards persists per-project tldraw whiteboards locally, the same
// posture as tasks/production: projects and users are APS-side (referenced by
// URN / OIDC sub), the server stores only its own data under the config dir.
//
// Storage differs from its siblings in one way that matters. A whiteboard's
// tldraw document is orders of magnitude larger than a task or a job — megabytes
// of shapes — and it is rewritten on every autosave. Keeping them all in one
// file per project (the tasks pattern) would mean serialising every board on
// each stroke, and shipping every board's document just to list their names. So
// the small, listable metadata lives in whiteboards.json while each document is
// its own <boardId>.json, written independently.
