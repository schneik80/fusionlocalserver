# Security Follow-ups

Originally findings from the security review of 2026-05-02. The high-severity
items (H1, H2) and the Python-injection mitigation (M2) shipped first. The
dedicated-server refactor (per-user login, TUI removal) then resolved or
obviated most of the rest. This file tracks what remains.

## Resolved

- [x] **M1. OAuth `state` parameter (CSRF).** The per-user login flow generates
  a random `state`, stores it server-side keyed to the in-flight login, and
  rejects the callback unless the `state` query param matches both that entry
  and the `fls_pending` cookie. See `server/auth.go` and `docs/authentication.md`.
- [x] **M3. Redact signed URLs from debug logs.** `api/debug.go` runs every
  trace line through `redactSignedURLs` before it reaches the console or log
  file, so `"signedUrl":"…"` values never appear in `-v` output.
- [x] **L3. Refresh `golang.org/x/text` / indirect deps.** Moot — removing the
  TUI dropped the last third-party dependency. The module is now pure Go
  standard library (no `go.sum`).
- [x] **L4. Bump the `go` directive.** Now `go 1.23`.
- [x] **TLS / `Secure` cookie.** `-tls` serves HTTPS (self-signed cert
  auto-generated/cached, or bring your own via `-tls-cert`/`-tls-key`); the
  session cookie's `Secure` flag is driven by `r.TLS`, so it is set whenever a
  request arrives over HTTPS. Closes the plaintext-cookie-sniffing exposure on
  the LAN when `-tls` (or a TLS-terminating front) is used.
- [x] **Session persistence across restarts.** Sessions are mirrored to
  `~/.config/fusionlocalserver/sessions.enc`, AES-256-GCM encrypted under a key
  file (`session.key`, 0600). This is encryption-at-rest of the refresh tokens,
  not OS-keychain storage (see below).

## Obviated by the architecture change

- **L2 / L5. `OpenBrowser` URL-scheme validation / error surfacing.** The server
  no longer opens a browser on the host (`OpenBrowser` was deleted with the
  loopback login). Each user authenticates in their own browser.

## New — deferred

- [ ] **APS app callback registration.** APS validates `redirect_uri` by
  exact match (no wildcards). Use **`-public-url`** to fix the callback to one
  canonical URL and register just that — the server redirects clients arriving
  via other hosts to it. Without it, the callback is derived per origin and each
  must be registered (`localhost` ≠ `127.0.0.1`, each LAN IP/hostname is
  separate, `-tls` makes it https). Still operator/portal work (and tied to the
  broader APS client_id/secret provisioning), so it stays deferred — but
  `-public-url` reduces it to a single registration.
- [ ] **Stronger token-at-rest (L1).** Persisted sessions are AES-256-GCM
  encrypted, but the key sits beside the data (`session.key`, 0600) — this
  defends a casual file read, not an attacker with the user's home directory. OS
  keychain / DPAPI / secret-service storage of the key (or the sessions) would
  be stronger.
